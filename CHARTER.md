# {{ New Group Name }} {{ New Group Type }} Charter

## Guidelines for Drafting a Charter

This document outlines the process for establishing a new group within RISC-V International. The charter should be developed during the group formation stage and receive approval from the sponsoring commitee. Please refer to the [Chairs Best Practices policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rtXskVd7YyFq74tQ2OrInyM_-OQa228R5UZs5Pm3Vz0/) for comprehensive guidance.

### Task Group (TG) Charter:
A robust TG charter explicitly outlines the group's objectives, particularly how the group intends to address specific gaps identified by the parent Special Interest Group (SIG) or Committee. It should detail a concise set of deliverables.

### Special Interest Group (SIG) Charter:
Unlike a Committee, a SIG focuses solely on strategizing, identifying gaps, setting priorities, and possibly initiating other SIGs or TGs to address those gaps. An effective SIG charter clarifies the strategic topics to be tackled and delineates its responsibilities, following the guidelines provided here.

NOTE: Remove this instructional section upon completion.
